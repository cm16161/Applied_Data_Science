Look into data more <- understand what is actually in the data
     -> Look at metadata
     -> unexpected properties
     -> "chy" vs "chimney" vs "c"? vs ....?
     -> squares vs circles for chimneys or other...?
     -> how many samples of data do we have
     -> how many are chy, how many are chimney etc
     -> how many squares/circles etc
     -> understanding ALL of the files -> .tif .tif.aux.xml etc
     -> get full overview of dataset
     -> ....

Stitch together coordinates -> putting the jig-saw together by combining the images
       -> using the coordinates...?
Image Recognition for "chy" or "chimney"
Image Recognition on squares/circles
Try to find more Cassini Maps
Look into existing work/publication
