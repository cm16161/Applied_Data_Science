Large Dataset <- 100GB+

Objective:
Digitize elements of maps
use map data of insdustrial chimneys to see how communities develop with
pollution and pollution clouds

Important Elements to Digitize:
    1. Take map and make a Google Map/OSM type thing
       * Unidentified polygons <- houses
    2. Elements that should be recognised
       * Chimneys <- most important
       * Given a random tile can observe what a chimney is and how it looks
       * Street Names
       * Public Amineties
	 * Churches
	 * Schools
	 * Banks
	 * etc

Chimneys and workshops/industries related to chimneys are most important to digitize

We have flexibility and scope to digitize what we want/find interesting

Priority is Industrial Chimneys!!

Detecting houses is interesting

The purpose is to make Google Maps
    * Labelled Features
    * Maps show items clearly
    * Humans can classify, so machine/program should
      * Use shape recognition

Our dataset is manually trained
Manully find chimneys, label with "x"
System to detect "x" to get locations

Chimneys show locations of industry/industrial areas

Turing Institute looking at maps as a whole and determine whether it is residential or industrial
Less focus on feature detection and digitizing

Key emphasis on digitizing features

Data Owner not entirely clear on definition of Data Science, doesn't understand the difference between
SDE, Data Science, ML/AI

Data Science is simple and not simple
Need additional data
Need data on outcomes:
    * He can provide data for us
    * Look at chimneys (automatic process)
      * generate pollution from chimneys
      * spread pollution around that area
      * sophisticated way:
	* dispertion model
	* use wind/weather pattern models
      * Simple way:
	* do it ourselves
	* use average wind patterns
	  * to spread pollution
	* weather station data to get wind patterns and generate pollution cloud
    * Can use geographic tool software
    * We have now created pollution but we have no outcome

Hypothesis on data
if we create pollution, it will affect the shape of the city in the long run
previous project
pollution affected neighbourhood sorting
    * social classes of residents
    * see more crime
    * school quality lower
    * types of houses change
We can get pollution data to create an outcome that we are interested in
We can capture some outcomes which census data
eg. Social housing or migrant population
Can combine pollution with census data to get an outcome for something we are interested in

Historical data is hard to get
So get census data for now

Past pollution has modified cities in the past
but this has long lasting implications which we now feel

How does Past Pollution affect current city layouts
Classify on historical data
    * see the effect of this in today's society

Key: NOT looking at MODERN pollution

Some maps show land-use

Combine pollution with some outcome
Data available for anything that we are interested in
Can get sattelite

If we want some historical outcome we don't have much in terms of datasets
Maps and historic census data are only reasonable options

How does pollution affect how poor an area is
    * are there trees?
    * types of houses <- villas vs terraced

Select one outcome
Tell him what we want and he will help us get the data that we need

Detecting chimneys and creating pollution will be the "difficult part"

The is 1 factor which explain why chimneys predict the presence of poor people
Chimney = factory = low-skilled workers
Could be related due to external factors due to commute time

Examine the effect of pollution
Not just close to the factory
Some sort of assymetric routes of pollution
   * weather
   * commuting

Detect chimneys and then find the affect of pollution in that area
we can choose what we are interested in

House Prices can be explored

We need to decide what data/outcome we want
Tell him and he can sort this out for us

1 or 2 is a limitation
Can we explore more options?
We wont be able to predict everything
There is too much
Useful if it can answer the question "what can this change?"

If we want to explore more options it is ok, just harder to come up with a solid conclusion

Maybe create our own outcomes
If we need data nowadays
any datasource which can be geolocalised can be used/useful

Websites exist that geolocate small crimes
