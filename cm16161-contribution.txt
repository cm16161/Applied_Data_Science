In the early stages of the project I was responsible for communicating with the data owner.
I scheduled the first few meetings with him and subsequently broke down the tasks which
were required for this project.
I would keep the supervisor informed of the status of the group and project as a whole
during all of the meetings
I was also responsible for the initial analysis of the map images and auxiliary files
provided by the data-owner.
Throughout the project I made sure that everyone had a task assigned to them, while
also performing work myself.
I was responsible for exploring and analysing the correlation between features extracted
on the maps to the number of crimes in an area. 
This involved finding and cleaning the available crime data for the UK, 
processing the large volumes of data by using Pandas Dataframes and generating heatmaps 
using Seaborn to visualise the results
I also performed the T-Test on the Crime Data


From this course I have learnt how to find and use publicly available data to serve some purpose.
I learnt how to use Pandas to create Dataframes from large CSV files, and then extract the most important
and relevant features. I also learnt how to use Python to create an efficient pipeline which could take
a filename and then process it until a desired output is returned.
Finally I learnt how best to visualise data by using the Seaborn library, and how to perform statistical tests on Data using Python and Pandas.
Going into this project I did not know much about Python so by using it in the project I learnt a lot.
I also learnt how to break a large task down into manageable pieces which can then be assigned to different people, and how to remotely work in a team.
